AVRProgs is really just an old junk drawer of AVR code, but it's really handy to have lying around if you're getting ramped back up on AVR after a long absence, so I've decided it's not too big an embarassment to post it to GitHub.

AVRProgs is also older than sin, hence this being the first commit.  If I ever go through another really heavy period of AVR development maybe I'll also tighten these up into a viable set of educational examples, but realistically that's probably an honor reserved for the HandmadeOS project.
